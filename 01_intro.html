<!--
Event:
In JavaScript, an event refers to any interaction or occurrence detected by the browser, such as a user action (clicking a button, moving the mouse, pressing a key), changes in the document (loading, resizing), or interactions with specific elements. Events enable dynamic interactions between users and a web application.


How Do Events Work?
Event Listener: A function (called a callback) that runs when the event is triggered.
Event Object: An object passed to the event listener function containing details about the event (e.g., which key was pressed, which element was clicked).



Common Events
    Mouse Events: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mouseenter, mouseleave, mousemove
    Keyboard Events: keydown, keyup, keypress
    Form Events: submit, change, focus, blur
    Window Events: load, resize, scroll


How to Handle Events in JavaScript?
There are three main ways to handle events:
    1.Inline Event Handlers
    2. HTML DOM Event Handlers
    3. Event Listeners  
    
    

Syntax of addEventListener
The addEventListener method attaches an event handler to an element.

    target.addEventListener(type, listener);
    
Parameters Explained
    1.target: The DOM element to which the event listener is attached (e.g., document, window, or any specific HTML element).

    2.type: A string representing the type of event (e.g., "click", "mouseover", "keydown", etc.).

    3. listener: The function that is executed when the event occurs. This can also be an anonymous function or a named function.




Event Object
The event listener function automatically receives an event object, which contains details about the event.

<!-- 1. Inline Event Handlers
You can directly attach events to an HTML element using its attributes. -->
    <button onclick="alert('Button was clicked')">Clic Me</button>



<!-- 2. HTML DOM Event Handlers
You can use JavaScript to assign an event handler to an element. -->
    <button id="btn">Clik me</button>
    <p id="message">Remove me</p>



<!-- 3. Event Listeners
The addEventListener method allows multiple event listeners on the same element without overwriting previous ones. -->
    <button id="hoverBtn">Hover over me</button>
    <p id="hoverMessage"></p>




<!-- 4. Event Object  -->
<button id="eventBtn">Click Event</button>




<!-- Prevent Default Behavior
The preventDefault method stops the browser's default action for an event. -->
<form id="myForm">
    <input type="text"  placeholder="Type somethings..." required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>




    <script>
        const button = document.getElementById('btn')
        button.onclick = function() {
            document.getElementById('message').innerText = ""
        }


        const hoverBtn = document.getElementById('hoverBtn')
        hoverBtn.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
            document.getElementById('hoverMessage').innerText = "Mouse is over the button"
        })


        const eventBtn = document.querySelector('#eventBtn')
        eventBtn.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
            console.log(event)
        })



        const form = document.getElementById("myForm");
        form.addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
            event.preventDefault
            
        })

    </script>

</body>
</html>
