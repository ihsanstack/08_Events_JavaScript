What is Event Propagation?
Event Propagation is the process by which events move through the DOM (Document Object Model) hierarchy. It determines the order in which elements receive events when an event occurs on a nested element. There are three phases in event propagation: 


Event Propagation Phases

1. Capturing Phase
In this phase:
    The event travels from the root element (document) to the target element.
    Listeners can capture the event during this phase by setting the third parameter in addEventListener to true (or using { capture: true }).

2. Target Phase
    This is when the event directly affects the target element.
    Event listeners attached to the target element can respond to the event here.

3. Bubbling Phase
    The event moves from the target element back up through its ancestors to the root.
    This is the default behavior for most events.

        // child.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        //     console.log("child click")
        // })

        // Child clicked
        // Parent clicked
        // This is due to the bubbling phase, where the event moves from the child to the parent.




        // Stopping Propagation
        // You can stop the event from propagating further by using:

        // event.stopPropagation(): Stops the event from propagating to parent elements in both capturing and bubbling phases.
        // event.stopImmediatePropagation(): Stops the event from propagating and prevents other listeners on the same element from being executed.

        //Event  Listener on child
        // child.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        //     console.log("child click")
        //     event.stopPropagation()
        // }, false)

        // //Event  Listener on parent
        //  parent.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        //     console.log("Parent click")
        // }, false)

        // output: Child clicked




        // Using Event Capturing
        // By setting { capture: true }, you can handle the event during the capturing phase.

        //Event  Listener on parent
        parent.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
            console.log("Parent click")
        }, true)

        //Event  Listener on child
        child.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
            console.log("child click")
        }, true)
